Developers instantiate UI components, and component listeners to hook into their application code. The components of the framework will already know how to respond to a variety of HCI actions (ex. scaling and rotating based on gestures from a multi-touch surface). But, the framework will simultaneously expose a component-based system for defining new gestures and HCI actions. Due to the scope of this framework, I intend to implement support for multi-touch initially. Later work can introduce support for other HCI mediums (i.e. tangibles, voice-recognition, eye-tracking, etc.)\r\n\r\nComponent Overview:\r\n* Text labels\r\n* Text \ffields\r\n* Buttons\r\n* Container frames\r\n* Sliders\r\n* Image frames\r\n* Knobs\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](http://nuicode.com/projects/gsoc-hci-java)\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2009 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2009](http://db.tt/Uai2WuQE)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2009)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Ori Rawlings\t\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Christian Moore","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
